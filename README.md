# unsupervised-MNIST-NN
This notebook uses a Convolutional Auto-encoder to perform unsupervised training on the MNIST dataset.
Dimensional Reduction and clustering techniques are then used to identify either separate digits (with 97.04% accuracy), or different styles of writing the same digit.
Different style identified include italic/non-italic, looped/unlooped 2's, open/closed 4's, barrred/unbarred 7's. 

Data is taken from the MNIST Database: https://git-disl.github.io/GTDLBench/datasets/mnist_datasets/
